## My current side project is [Model Based IoT](https://github.com/TCC2021SeniorProject)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model based IoT is a project that converts UPPAAL model into a python code so that user can directly inject the output code to embedded system.

### Which algorithm is applied? And what have I learned?

> 1. Application of DFS,BFS, and other heap datastructures to store and traverse objects.
>
> 2. Applied parser-tree data structure. Understanding of XML parsing algorithm.
>
> 3. Organize an entire software structure to have better readability and better portability.
>
> 4. Handling with various amount of class objects
>
> 5. Synchronous and asynchronous function calls
>
> 6. Server interaction with Raspberry Pi 4 and wireless devices
